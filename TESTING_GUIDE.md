# OpenRouter Integration Testing Guide

## ✅ Issues Fixed

The following critical issues have been resolved in your OpenRouter integration:

### 🔧 **1. Broken Streaming Implementation**
- **Problem**: `doStream` method was treating streaming responses as single JSON objects
- **Solution**: Implemented proper Server-Sent Events (SSE) parsing with chunk processing
- **Impact**: Real-time streaming now works correctly

### 🔧 **2. Missing Content-Type Header**
- **Problem**: API requests were missing required `Content-Type: application/json` header
- **Solution**: Added proper headers in `openrouter-provider.ts`
- **Impact**: OpenRouter API now properly recognizes request format

### 🔧 **3. Improved Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Generic "Failed to fetch" errors with no specifics
- **Solution**: Added detailed error parsing with fallback handling
- **Impact**: Specific OpenRouter API error messages are now shown

### 🔧 **4. TypeScript Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Type mismatches causing compilation failures
- **Solution**: Fixed header types and context binding issues
- **Impact**: Code compiles cleanly and runs reliably

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Manual Integration Test**

Run this script to test the OpenRouter API directly:

```bash
# Set your OpenRouter API key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-your-api-key-here"

# Run the integration test
node test-openrouter-integration.js
```

This script tests:
- ✅ Non-streaming chat completion
- ✅ Streaming chat completion  
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Header formatting

### **Step 2: Build the Extension**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run TypeScript compilation check
pnpm run compile

# Run linting
pnpm run lint

# Build for development
pnpm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Load in Browser**

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `.wxt/chrome-mv3` folder
4. The extension should load without errors

### **Step 4: Configure OpenRouter**

1. Click the extension icon and open Settings
2. Go to **Debug** section:
   - Set **Provider** to `OpenRouter`
3. Go to **General** section:
   - Set **Base URL** to: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
   - Enter your **OpenRouter API Key**
4. Go to **Chat** section:
   - Select a model (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`)

### **Step 5: Test Messaging**

1. Open the side panel
2. Send a test message: "Hello, can you tell me a short joke?"
3. Verify:
   - ✅ Response appears in real-time (streaming)
   - ✅ No "Failed to fetch" errors
   - ✅ Response quality is good
   - ✅ Model attribution is correct

### **Step 6: Test Different Models**

Try these models to ensure broad compatibility:
- `openai/gpt-4o-mini` (fast & cheap)
- `anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku` (Claude alternative)
- `google/gemini-flash-1.5` (Google model)
- `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` (open source)

### **Step 7: Test Error Scenarios**

1. **Invalid API Key**:
   - Enter wrong API key
   - Try to send message
   - Should show specific error message

2. **Network Issues**:
   - Disconnect internet briefly
   - Try to send message
   - Should show network error

3. **Invalid Model**:
   - Try selecting a non-existent model
   - Should handle gracefully

## 🎯 Expected Results

### ✅ **Success Indicators**
- Extension loads without console errors
- OpenRouter models appear in model selector
- Messages send and receive responses
- Streaming works (text appears in real-time)
- Proper error messages for issues
- Debug console shows successful API calls

### ❌ **Failure Indicators**
- "Failed to fetch" errors
- No response from models
- Missing models in selector
- Generic error messages
- Console errors about OpenRouter

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "No models available"**
- ✅ Check API key is valid
- ✅ Verify base URL is `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
- ✅ Check OpenRouter service status
- ✅ Ensure you have credits in OpenRouter account

### **Issue: "Failed to fetch"**
- ✅ Check browser console for CORS errors
- ✅ Verify extension permissions
- ✅ Test with integration script first
- ✅ Check network connectivity

### **Issue: "Model not responding"**
- ✅ Try different model (gpt-4o-mini is most reliable)
- ✅ Check OpenRouter dashboard for model availability
- ✅ Verify model name format is correct

### **Issue: "Generic error messages"**
- ✅ Check browser console for detailed errors
- ✅ Verify Content-Type header is being sent
- ✅ Test API key with curl command

## 🔧 Development Notes

### **Files Modified**
- `utils/llm/providers/openrouter/openrouter-chat-language-model.ts` - Fixed streaming + headers
- `utils/llm/providers/openrouter/openrouter-provider.ts` - Added Content-Type header
- `utils/llm/providers/openrouter/openrouter-chat-language-model.test.ts` - Fixed tests

### **Key Implementation Details**
- SSE parsing handles malformed chunks gracefully
- Error handling tries JSON parsing first, falls back to statusText  
- Headers properly filtered to avoid undefined values
- Stream processing uses TextDecoder for proper UTF-8 handling

### **Performance Characteristics**
- First request may be slower (connection establishment)
- Streaming reduces perceived latency
- Error recovery is immediate
- Model switching is instant
